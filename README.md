📈 Infection Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
A Complete End-to-End Predictive Analytics Case Study

⭐ Why This Project Matters (For Recruiters)

This repository demonstrates my ability to:

Build a real end-to-end machine learning pipeline

Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

Convert messy raw data into actionable insights

Apply ML to a relevant public-health domain

Communicate results clearly through a structured analytical workflow

It represents how I approach real-world analytics problems—focusing on reproducibility, clarity, and business value.

🔍 1. Project Overview

This project predicts whether an individual is at high risk of infection based on demographic, behavioral, and medical attributes.
The objective is to support early identification for healthcare prioritization and risk management.

The workflow covers:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Multiple model comparisons

Performance evaluation

Report summarizing findings

🧠 2. Key Skills Demonstrated

Machine Learning (Supervised Classification)

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC

Exploratory Data Analysis

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook Documentation

Reproducible ML Project Structure

Communicating insights with clarity

These skills align directly with roles such as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, ML Engineer, Business Analyst, and Health Analytics roles.
